  "conclusion": [
    "Thinking back on the creation of Nooti made me realise the mistakes I made and what could have been done better. For starters, the app was very rudimentary in its functionality. A hobbyist could consider it acceptable for a pet-project, but it offered no real value, nor did it benefit the general public in any meaningful way. There were also some design inconsistencies, and it had subpar user experience.",
    "Ultimately Nooti was removed from the Google Play Store due to a violation of the guidelines. The violation, you ask? Nooti's splash screen logo was too big.",
    "Keeping all this in mind, I did learn a substantial amount from this project. Looking back and seeing all the mistakes I made proves my growth as a software developer."
