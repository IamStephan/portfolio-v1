  "outline": {
    "goal": "The goal was to increase the handling of customer requests concerning transactional documents.",
    "scope": "The app needed a way to generate and send PDF documents to clients while keeping records of all related information.",
    "industry": "Mobility Crunch operates in the medical industry and helps with transactional documents."

      "content": [
        "Mobility Crunch can generate four types of PDF documents that the user can view from within the device. When the documents are ready, Mobility Crunch can then send it to the user's provided email address."

      "title": "Inventory and order history",
      "showcase": "./assets/challenge_two.png",
      "content": [
        "One of the app's functionalities is that it can store information about the products the client uses inside an inventory. This speeds up the process of creating transactional documents and eliminates the possibility for errors.",
        "Mobility Crunch also keeps track of the order history and allows the client to expand on the order instead of creating a new one."

      "showcase": "./assets/challenge_three.png",
      "content": [
        "Since the app is mobile-driven, it needed offline capabilities. I used Firebase as the source of truth, and once connectivity is established, the app starts to sync with all the other devices."

  "conclusion": [
    "One of the app's significant drawbacks was that I needed an Apple device to publish it to the App Store. To overcome this, I converted the app to an Expo project and let the client use it through that.",
    "Mobility Crunch has been immensely successful, so much so that the client requested a follow-up version to expand and grow the idea behind it."
