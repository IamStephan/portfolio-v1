  "conclusion": [
    "When starting with this project, I decided to build most of the platform from the ground-up, but due to time constraint I ended up using Strapi for the back-end with a few custom plugins. There where, however, a few other constraints I had to keep in mind but the project proved itself to be quite managable.",
    "Since most of the back-end was complete, I mostly had to focus on architecting the front-end. I ended up trying to use the MVC architecture for the frontend; with react being the View, Strapi the Model and state machinces for the Controller. This allowed me to scale the platoform, while keeping a sound mind of where everything was and how it worked.",
    "SEO, performance and accessibly were aided by the use of Gatsby, allowing me to focus on more thought provoking tasks like the cart functionality and order managment.",
    "All-in-all the project broadened my knowledge on numerous aspects of such a large scale project and it certainly expanded my ability to work on large scale projects."
