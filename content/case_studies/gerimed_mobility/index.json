  "conclusion": [
    "When starting with this project, I decided to build most of the platform from the ground-up, but I ended up using Strapi for the back-end with a few custom plugins due to time constraint. However, the project proved to be quite manageable.",
    "Since most of the back-end was complete, I mostly had to focus on architecting the front-end. I ended up trying to use the MVC architecture for the front-end; react being the View, Strapi the Model and state machines for the Controller. This allowed me to scale the platform while keeping a sound mind of where everything was and how it worked.",
    "Gatsby provided me with various tools for; SEO, performance and accessibility. This allowed me to focus on more thought-provoking tasks, like cart functionality and order management.",
    "All-in-all the project broadened my knowledge on numerous aspects of large scale projects, and it expanded my ability to work on said projects."
