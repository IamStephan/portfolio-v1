  title: Creating my portfolio
  date: 2021-01-22
  overview:
    Having a portfolio is an essential part of being a developer.
    "Just create a simple landing page and put all your projects in it."
    Seems simple enough, but in practice, I found myself struggling more with my portfolio than my other projects.
